## This script is executed on the production server via SSH by the GitHub Actions workflow.
## It performs the zero-downtime blue/green deployment.

## Environment variables (passed from the GitHub Action):
# - WORK_DIR: The application's working directory on the server.
# - IMAGE_NAME: The full name of the Docker image registry (e.g., ghcr.io/user/repo)
# - APP_URL: The public URL for health checking.
# - WEB_SERVICE_BASE: Base name for web services (e.g., actuallyfind-web)
# - DB_SERVICE: Database service name.
# - TYPESENSE_SERVICE: Typesense service name.
# - QUEUE_SERVICE: Queue service name.
# - DEPLOY_TAG: The tag of the image to deploy (always 'production').
# - DOCKER_*_PORT: Host port variables (now passed directly from the Action)
